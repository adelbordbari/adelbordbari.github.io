It all started with a sarcastic jab in a casual chat: _“You shouldn’t be more Catholic than the Pope. You go to order a coffee, and the guy’s like, ‘From Kenyan farms or Brazil?’ It’s like going to Italy for ghormeh sabzi, and they ask if you want the herbs from Bostanabad or Tuyserkan! For God’s sake, stop with the pretension—we just want an espresso to drink and get on with our lives :))”_

It’s hilarious, sure, but it’s also painfully true. When did grabbing a coffee turn into a full-blown performance?

## Let’s rewind a bit
Coffee in Iran? Oh, we were sipping it long before tea became the national obsession. Back in the [Safavid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safavid_dynasty) days, coffeehouses were the heart of social life—places for storytelling, debates, and a quick cup of something strong. No one was waxing poetic about “floral notes” or “single-origin beans.” Then the Qajar era rolled in, tea took over, and coffee was relegated to the sidelines. Fast forward to today, and coffee’s back with a vengeance, but it’s draped in so much pomp and circumstance you’d think it’s auditioning for an Oscar.

## These modern cafés
They’re less about coffee and more about selling you a lifestyle; _one you didn’t even know you needed_. Walk into one, and the menu reads like a novella: “Ethiopian Yirgacheffe with hints of jasmine and citrus.” Oh, please. It’s not a drink; it’s a personality trait. This isn’t about quenching your thirst—it’s about **feeding your ego**. The whole setup is a shallow charade, designed to make you feel like you’re part of some exclusive club, when really, you’re just another sucker buying into the hype.

## Why all the fuss
It’s a business trick, plain and simple. Cafés have figured out how to slice and dice their customers like a marketing pie. Some folks just want a no-nonsense coffee (good luck finding that). Others are chasing the thrill of a “unique experience,” as if their morning brew needs a backstory worthy of a TED Talk. Then there’s the Instagram crowd, who’d rather photograph their latte art than drink it. By slapping fancy names and origin stories on every cup, cafés ensure everyone’s wallet gets a workout. It’s capitalism dressed up as culture.
The irony is that this whole coffee culture in Iran is still in diapers. In Italy, ordering an espresso is as routine as brushing your teeth—quick, simple, done. But here? It’s a spectacle. Cafés lean hard into the jargon and theatrics to scream “modernity✨!” because, let’s face it, this isn’t a deeply rooted tradition—it’s a borrowed trend. The over-the-top menus and barista banter are just a shiny distraction to mask how hollow it all is. And don’t get me started on social media. That “Guatemalan cold brew” isn’t just a drink; it’s your ticket to a viral post.

## What’s driving this madness
Customers, that’s who. People are so desperate to fill the voids in their lives—boredom, insecurity, whatever—that they’ll pay extra for a coffee with a fancy label. It’s not about taste; it’s about signaling you’re “in the know.” Cafés know this and exploit it mercilessly, turning a simple beverage into a status symbol. The result? You’re not drinking coffee; you’re drinking your own need for validation.
Sure, you could argue this café craze is becoming part of Iran’s urban identity. In cities like Tehran or Isfahan, cafés are now hubs for work, meetups, and even small classes! But let’s not kid ourselves—this “culture” is mostly a commercial stunt. It’s a far cry from the raw, unpretentious vibe of old-school coffeehouses, where the coffee was just coffee, not a therapy session in a cup.
Looking back at that friend’s rant, he nailed it. Back then, coffee was a means to an end—fuel for life, not a lifestyle. Today’s cafés, with their bloated menus and self-important vibes, are just preying on our insecurities. We’re not savoring coffee; we’re chasing a fleeting sense of purpose. And honestly? I’d trade all the “single-origin” nonsense for one straightforward espresso and a chance to get on with my day.

## The kicker
This whole façade isn’t going anywhere because too many lives depend on it. Baristas, café owners, influencers, and even the customers who’ve built their entire personalities around “_being a coffee person_”, they’re all in too deep. Their jobs, their social clout, their carefully curated Instagram feeds hinge on this pretentious coffee circus. Worse still, this trend is swallowing every other coffee subculture whole. Want a decent, simple coffee? Tough luck. Your options are either a sad, watery drip from a corner shop or an overpriced pour-over that comes with a red carpet and a side of self-importance. That’s the real tragedy—good coffee doesn’t exist here without the baggage anymore.
