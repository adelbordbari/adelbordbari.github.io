### bandcamp radio
Since I started working my first 9-5 job, I've been sailing the uncharted waters of my mental and physical stability. this resulted in battling against undiscovered foes, namely managing my sleep schedule, focusing at will, planning my days, and loggin my work. I realized music helps a lot with the first two (also a small drink/snack but that's beyond the scope of this writing).

newsflash: every streaming service is banned where I live; either sanctioned from the outter world or prohibited from the inside. so started the digging and the shoveling through lists of streaming services. some self-hosted (Navidrome, Ampache, etc.), some genre-specific (funkwhale), some ugly (Sockso) and some aesthetically pleasing (forte). I found most of them to be of no use for my current condition and use-cases.

Finally I settled with Bandcamp. it's a very unique experience since:
- it's not even a streaming, but a music distribution platform
- it does NOT have autoplay (you have to manually click to play every song, every time)
- there's a very intimate connection between the listener and the artist
- I can NOT download the files (as I normally do) for later local listens; because the artists are mostly too obscure to be found anywhere (for downloads that is! I do occasionally find them on other major streaming platforms like YouTube Music).
- as an amateur musician myself, I can easily sense the production process while listening to the music
- Bandcamp Radio! a great radio(-like) show that helps me hear VERY new sounds. be it genre, instrumentation, artist, etc. without trapping me inside a filter bubble. there are often annotation and interviews with artists as well.
- I admire the platform philosophically
