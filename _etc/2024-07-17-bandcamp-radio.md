## Listening Experience
It's oftentimes obvious that "how" we do something, has direct influence on "what" we do; even the most irrelevant factors can sometimes come into play.
for example if you're refactoring a piece of code, not only do your technical skills matter in the process (how familiar you are to the codebase/framework/paradigms/etc.), but also do the way you approach the task at hand. from mildly relevant factors (e.g., work environment. is your screen too bright that your eyes are sore after 20 minutes? is your chair comfortable enough? are you hearing a lot of noise?) to even the most seemingly unasociated matters (e.g, your mental/physical state. your last night's fight with your landlady, the dead bird you saw on the street this morning, or your payrolls that are due this week). there are not even [butterfly effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect)s, since the mediary elements are easily countable and recalled.

Narrowing this down, while listening to things, not only does "what you listen to" affects "what you hear", but so does "how you're listening to it". this can range from various technologies (vinyl, cassette tape, your cellphone speaker, 320kbps pirated `.mp3s`? lossless `.flac` files 300mb each?) to all the nostalgia and biases you carry from childhood (the bully in your class loved Green Day and now it reminds you of him? the girl next door loved TLC? your mom sang you to sleep with Blackbird?).

The question of "what you listen" is extremely subjective, and I've grown to believe that it's "ok" for people to listen to what I dislike, and I can still like them despite their cheap inferior taste (still a work in progress). so I leave this part out.

## Today
Since I started working my first 9-5 job, I've been sailing the uncharted waters of my mental and physical stability. this resulted in battling against undiscovered foes, namely managing my sleep schedule, focusing at will, planning my days, and logging my work. I realized music helps a lot with the first two (also a small drink/snack but that's beyond the scope of this writing).

newsflash: every streaming service is banned where I live; either sanctioned from the outer world or prohibited from the inside. so started the digging and the shoveling through lists of streaming services. some self-hosted (Navidrome, Ampache, etc.), some genre-specific (funkwhale), some ugly (Sockso) and some aesthetically pleasing (forte). I found most of them to be of no use for my current condition and use-cases.

Finally I settled with Bandcamp. it's a very unique experience since:
- it's not even a streaming, but a music distribution platform
- it does NOT have autoplay (you have to manually click to play every song, every time. well, except when listening to albums)[^1]
- there's a very intimate connection between the listener and the artist
- I can NOT download the files (as I normally do) for later local listens; because the artists are mostly too obscure to be found anywhere (for downloads that is! I do occasionally find them on other major streaming platforms like YouTube Music).
- as an amateur musician myself, I can easily sense the production process while listening to the music
- Bandcamp Radio! a great radio(-like) show that helps me hear VERY new sounds. be it genre, instrumentation, artist, etc. without trapping me inside a filter bubble. there are often annotation and interviews with artists as well.
- I admire the platform philosophically. the body of work that's showcased is beautifully channelled and distributed for the right audience.


[^1]: although Bandcamp does not hold a philosophical standpoint towards this and it's more about the UX, I like the result. to quote the Bandcamp Help Center:
    > ***How do I make the embedded player autostart?***  
    > *Welcome home! We trust your eight-year expedition to the heart of the Amazon was a great success. SO much has happened since you left. The first Delawarean was elected Vice President of the United States, the Chronicles of Riddick defied box office expectations, and tabbed browsers became commonplace. As a result, many web enthusiasts now open tabs as they surf. Autostarting media players donâ€™t play well with this behavior, since they put you in a position of wondering whoah, where is that sound coming from and then force you to play find-the-tab-making-your-eardrums-bleed. AUTOSTART IS EVIL is a fairly common refrain nowadays, and who are we to disagree?*
