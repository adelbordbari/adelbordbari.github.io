📝 متن فارسی:

آتشی شب در نیستانی فتاد  
سوخت چون عشقی که در جانی فتاد  

شعله تا مشغول کار خویش شد  
هر نیی شمعِ مزار خویش شد  

نی به آتش گفت کاین آشوب چیست  
مر ترا زین سوختن مطلوب چیست  

گفت آتش بی سبب نفروختم  
دعوی بی معنی‌ات را سوختم  

زانکه می‌گفتی نی‌ام با صد نمود  
همچنان دربند خود بودی که بود  

با چنین دعوی چرا ای کم عیار  
برگ خود می‌ساختی هر نوبهار  

مرد را دردی اگر باشد خوش است  
درد بی‌دردی علاجش آتش است  

🌐 Close English Translation:

    A fire broke out in the reedbed one night,
    It burned like love flaring up in a soul.

    As the flame got busy with its task,
    Each reed became a candle on its own grave.

    The reed asked the fire: “What is this turmoil?
    What do you seek in burning me like this?”

    The fire replied: “I did not burn you without cause —
    I burned your meaningless claim.”

    “You said, ‘I am a hollow reed’ with many masks,
    Yet remained imprisoned in your same old self.”

    “With such a false claim, O shallow one,
    Why did you keep sprouting leaves every spring?”

    “If a man carries pain, that is good —
    But the cure for painlessness is fire.”

🔍 Line-by-Line Jungian Interpretation:
🔥 آتشی شب در نیستانی فتاد

A fire broke out in the reedbed one night

    The sudden emergence of fire symbolizes a psychic crisis — a deep disturbance in the unconscious erupting into consciousness, often triggered by a transformative event like love, grief, or awakening.

🔥 سوخت چون عشقی که در جانی فتاد

It burned like love flaring up in a soul

    Just like Jung saw eros (love) as a destabilizing yet creative force, this line shows how passion can dismantle the ego’s false peace.

🔥 شعله تا مشغول کار خویش شد

As the flame got busy with its task

    Once the unconscious begins its work (dreams, symptoms, passions), it doesn’t stop — the fire here is the Self reclaiming its authority over the ego.

🔥 هر نیی شمعِ مزار خویش شد

Each reed became a candle on its own grave

    Each egoic identity burns at its own funeral — like the persona being sacrificed during individuation, allowing deeper truths to emerge.

🔥 نی به آتش گفت کاین آشوب چیست

The reed asked the fire: What is this turmoil?

    The conscious ego resists transformation, fearing loss of control. It doesn’t understand the deeper meaning behind the crisis.

🔥 مر ترا زین سوختن مطلوب چیست

What do you seek in burning me like this?

    This is the ego’s demand: “Why is this happening to me?” — a refusal to see the purpose in suffering.

🔥 گفت آتش بی سبب نفروختم

The fire replied: I did not burn you without cause

    The Self answers: transformation is not arbitrary. The suffering has a meaning, even if the ego cannot grasp it yet.

🔥 دعوی بی معنی‌ات را سوختم

I burned your meaningless claim

    The fire destroys the ego’s false self-image — a Jungian shadow confrontation, exposing the lies we tell ourselves.

🔥 زانکه می‌گفتی نی‌ام با صد نمود

You said, ‘I am a hollow reed’ with many masks

    The reed pretends to be spiritually empty (humble), but wears many personas — spiritual inflation or self-deception.

🔥 همچنان دربند خود بودی که بود

Yet remained imprisoned in your same old self

    Despite the claims, the ego remains stuck — undeveloped, trapped in repetition and denial.

🔥 با چنین دعوی چرا ای کم عیار

With such a false claim, O shallow one

    The fire mocks the ego’s spiritual performance, exposing its lack of substance.

🔥 برگ خود می‌ساختی هر نوبهار

Why did you keep sprouting leaves every spring?

    The ego keeps renewing itself superficially, reinventing the persona rather than surrendering to transformation.

🔥 مرد را دردی اگر باشد خوش است

If a man carries pain, that is good

    Jung said neurosis is often the avoidance of legitimate suffering — pain can be the path to wholeness.

🔥 درد بی‌دردی علاجش آتش است

But the cure for painlessness is fire

    When there is no inner struggle, no authentic suffering, the only remedy is a spiritual fire — a psychic breaking open.

🧭 Conclusion: Fire as the Path to Wholeness

This poem is a masterclass in symbolic psychology. The fire is not destruction for its own sake — it is transformation, the only cure for falsehood and stagnation. The ego (the reed) clings to its illusions of identity and spiritual posturing, but the Self (the fire) demands authenticity.

Jung taught that the path to individuation runs through darkness, pain, and confrontation with the shadow. This poem shows that same truth: only through burning can we become truly hollow — ready to receive the divine breath.
