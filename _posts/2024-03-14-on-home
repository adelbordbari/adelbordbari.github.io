> What is a home if not the first place you learn to run from?  
> -- Clementine von Radics

There's usually a love-hate relationship when it comes to the notion of "home". we sometimes treasure the comfort, familiarity, and predictability that it provides; and sometimes feel frustrated with the feeling of being stuck, stationary, and trapped in it. the idea of home is intertwined with the idea of identity, and belonging. I need to know what I "am" to put everything else in place, to know what I am not, and to know what's only an extension of who I am. I need a center of gravity so that I can form my own constellations of emotions and contemplations, centered by my notion of the self.

I find here a crucial challenges: to weigh and compare two main components: what I am, and what I am not (or, what I want to be and what I want to not be). to know which of these plays a more prominent role in my journey towards self-definition. I believe an agile personality is one that focuses more heavily on the first: the becomings. it aspires, thrives, aims, grows, and eventually achieves. there are more possibilities than precautions. in this way I always have other alternatives, if ever one fails me.
equally important, is the second element: the limiter, the control element. the danger sign that ceases acceleration. my common sense that allows when to slow down, or even stop. among all the options the first element provides, I pick via this control element. what suits here, now? I'm already at the crossroads, but which way to go next? they're very much based on the categories we belong. e.g., I think I'm a decent guy, therefore whenever I have the option to deceit, I refuse. since it's in contrast with the group of people I think I'm a part of: "decent people don't deceit".
I prefer having a balance of them both, but slightly leaning towards the first. I want to have more mistakes than regrets. 

There's one pitfall to this as well. be hesitant to categorize yourself, as one individual decision is almost never significant enough to label your whole personality. it's really intuitive, I don't have a system to know the line yet. what's the most deceitful thing I -as a decent person- do, that does not make an un-decent person? very vague and variable.

with all this said, these are all the possible "realm"s of belonging I can fit myself into:

## My Mind
The mind is where we spend most of our time; I know I do. we constantly think, decide, compare, remember, plan, and all sorts of other mind activities that require us to be present in our consciousness. 

## My Body
## My Family
## My House
## My City
## My Country
## The Earth
## The Universe
