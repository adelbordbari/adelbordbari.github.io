## Introduction
It's obvious why knowing English is crucial in today's world. moreover, the learning process of a second(or more!) language is rewarding on its own. I'll explain both separately:

### Why English
The short answer is that because [the internet is American](/the-internet-is-american/). all the apps you use, the lines of code you write, and the pages of documentation you read (namely, this article) are in English. for somebody without a minimum fluency in English, it's inevitable to not feel left out, outdated, or even unfitting at some point; at least in their digital life.

What's really interesting in this situation is that before that point of realization, the person might just not notice the feeling of being left out. they might not notice how much is being overlooked. they just get along with it, never having bothered (or been forced) to try. that is because we humans are very good at adapting to our surroundings. as any discovery needs a motivation: either a pulling welcome from the outside or a pushing exile from the inside. mine was the latter, and in an indirect manner by my parents because I was too young to experience either.

### The Learning of A Language
As I said before, I see language as a very crucial and philosophical aspect of my life. I take extra care when choosing words, phrases, and even tones. it's a very impulsive and instinctual skill, but the goal is to stay as conscious as possible about it. some of it is deep inside us, that's how parents can understand what their child needs by hearing the sound of the baby's crying. there's a more fundamental force at work here than the very abstract, symbolic tool we call language.

However, a baby can not cry in more than a handful of tones. I reckon that he doesn't need to either, but an adult does. the older we grow, the more complicated our lives become; so we need more complex symbols to convey those ideas and thoughts too.
> Man, for many philosophers both ancient and modern, is the "representational animal," homo symbolicum [sic], the creature whose distinctive character is the creation and manipulation of signs - things that stand for or take the place of something else.[^1]
> from "An Essay on Man" by [W. J. T. Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._J._T._Mitchell)

In order to have sophisticated conversations, understandings, and thoughts, we need equally sophisticated symbols, vocabulary, and articulation. the trick here is to not get lost in translation, and to stay loyal to the pure idea as much as possible. you have two variables at hand: first is how important this information is to you, and second is how much boredom you're willing to go through in order to understand the message. this is why (serious) philosophical essays are often long, boring, and tedious because every piece of jargon must be come to terms with, between the author and the audience. you write "_I had a hard time working with X_", first both sides need to agree on what use of language this is. it should be agreed upon as consciously as possible. next to be on the same page about every word in use. Heidegger is famous for making up his own words, he's hard to read but the same fact makes him one of the most precise writers of his age.

This is very crucial in writing and often goes overlooked. when thinking in our head we don't need to explain every word to ourselves, because we simply know what we're talking about! however, it's very different in writing or even conversations (that include more than one person) because there must be a mutual understanding. not only we're transferring the message itself, but we're also transferring all the related metadata of the message. metadata can include tone, manner, timing, or accent. you can use the kindest of words with intonations that make them sound brutally rude, and vice versa. the message is received consciously and the metadata unconsciously. you hear words but "sense" the intonation.

Our lives define the language we use, and the language we use alters our lives too. it's affected by our geography, era of time, social circle, family class, and later our own attempts to educate ourselves. moreover, it impacts on what people you attract, how socially acceptable you are, how well others can understand you, how you place yourself in your social class, and many more.

Its deficiencies are also very complicated since they can result from a problem in several faculties: physical, neurological, hereditary, or even psychological. sometimes it has more than one reasons, which result in more complex situations like [Mixed receptive expressive language disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_receptive-expressive_language_disorder). this is to say that many forces are at work when we speak, many of which we are not even aware of.

To wrap up, for me, language is a layer of abstraction on top of our perception of the reality of life.
