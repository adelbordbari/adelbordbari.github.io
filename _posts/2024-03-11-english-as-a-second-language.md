## Introduction
It's obvious why knowing English is crucial in today's world. moreover, the learning process of a second(or more!) language is rewarding on its own. I'll explain both separately:

### Why English
The short answer is that because the internet is American. all the apps you use, the lines of code you write, and the pages of documentation you read (namely, this article) are in English. for somebody without a minimum fluency in English, it's inevitable to not feel left out, outdated, or even unfitting at some point; at least in their digital life.

What's really interesting in this situation is that before that point of realization, the person might just not notice the feeling of being left out. they might not notice how much is being overlooked. they just get along with it, never having bothered (or been forced) to try. that is because we humans are very good at adapting to our surroundings. as any discovery needs a motivation: either a pulling welcome from the outside or a pushing exile from the inside. mine was the latter, and in an indirect manner by my parents because I was too young to experience either.

### The Learning of A Language
As I said before, I see language as a very crucial and philosophical aspect of my life. I take extra care when choosing words, phrases, and even tones. it's a very impulsive and instinctual skill, but the goal is to stay as conscious as possible about it. some of it is deep inside us, that's how parents can understand what their child needs by hearing the sound of the baby's crying. there's a more fundamental force at work here than the very abstract, symbolic tool we call language.

However, a baby can not cry in more than a handful of tones. I reckon that it doesn't need to either, but an adult does. the older we grow, the more complicated our lives become; so we need more complex symbols to convey those ideas and thoughts too. w
