## Introduction
After my degree, I had the time to spend two years in the military. I decided to use my option to spend my time as [an employee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Iran#Non-Military_Conscription_(Persian:_%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B2_%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%87)) (instead of a soldier at a base). I'll try to skip the nitty gritty details...

After finishing my M.S. I started the first month of work (actually, right after! exactly two days after. This is crucial since where I lived, studied, and worked were all different cities.). Based on what we had agreed on, I had to spend one month of trial employment. after that six months more employment (for the sake of bureaucracy, and since I had no "privileges"[^1]), getting enlisted, two months of military training, then _finally_ starting the two years... there's a lot of paperwork in the process and the company can (quite literally) throw me away at any point without even a reason. I was required to write them a cheque as a "token of good faith" (which is very common, apparently) but there's no guarantee from their side.

With summer beginning, I moved to Tehran, rented a house, and started my first "trial" month. a 9-5 job, close to where I live, in a vibrant lively city, not very bad I guess.

## Footnotes
[^1]: since several years ago, "skilled soldiers" can spend their service as employees in tech-based companies. there are many, MANY terms of conditions. in order to attend the program, applicants need to reach a minimum "score". this score is calculated based on certain privileges, including being married, having offspring, being among the families of martyrs/veterans, active [Basij](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basij) membership, etc. I didn't have any of those, therefore I had to spend at least six months in the company as a regular employee to reach the minimum score.
