This statement frequently comes up as a given; and for good reasons too!

It started, developed, and lives in the US. you can access it from the most remote villages anywhere in the world but nonetheless, it's American in every sense of the word: hegemonic, manipulative, jumbled. companies like TikTok or Spotify (with their HQs outside of the US) might give us the idea that the internet is a global phenomenon, but that's not correct. aside from the obvious element of language, any new idea must be tailored, even butchered to fit the average American's needs and lifestyle: swallow (and I mean that both literally and figuratively).
