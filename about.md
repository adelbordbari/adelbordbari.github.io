My name is Adel(عادل), I'm from Iran. I write my opinions, reviews, rants, and coding challenges here, at least the ones I consider interesting.

I've studied software engineering and AI at university, and I currently work as a backend developer. I like photography, story-writing, films, languages, travelling, computers, guitars, geography, and internet culture.
