My name is Adel(عادل), I'm from Iran. I write my opinions and coding challenges here, at least the ones I consider interesting.

I'm studying artificial intelligence at university. I work as a backend developer, too. I'm researching drug side effects for my thesis which is due to be published in July 2024. I'm busy with my storybook that's supposed to be published by June 2024 as well.
