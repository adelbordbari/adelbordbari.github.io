## Also From This Artist
- [Five Leaves Left (1969)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _album/2024-03-08-five-leaves-left-nick-drake.md %})

## Preface
Very short and minimalistic. did not feel like an "album", just a series of unfinished ideas (except a few songs). the poetry is indeed undisputed but everything else could be much more refined and built-upon. a remastered version with more strings (and etcetera accompaniments?) would be at least interesting, if not necessary.

## Review
**Pink Moon** starts with familiar guitar strums. very intimate, as if he's singing on the other side of the room. it doesn't feel as lonely because of 
the piano that comes in after a minute. a bit too short!

**Places to Be** sounds much more breathy and more like Five Leaves Left.

> And I was green, greener than the hill...  
> Now I'm darker than the deepest sea

Nothing really interesting happens until **Things Behind The Sun**. I love the tension between vocal melody and the guitar strums. 

> Don't be shy, you learn to fly  
> And see the sun when day is done, if only you see  
> Just what you are beneath a star  
> That came to say one rainy day in autumn for free  
> Yes, be what you'll be  

**Parasite** includes the twisting chords a lot more. the unexpected "!?" chords. the lyrics are very isolated and frustrated: "_I am the parasite who
hangs from your skirt_". the meters are still a bit hard for me to follow through! not sure if they're actually odd meters (although I've heard 
songs of his in 5/4).

the songs are annoyingly short, so is the album. it's in a rush to just be over with everything and go home. 
**Day is Done** relatively sounds much more defined and well produced.

The album ended abruptly, leaving me waiting and slightly confused.
