## Preface

## Review
Starts with **All Alone**, laid-back, a bit vanilla tbh, nothing specifically interesting. riff-based with a distorted  guitar solo. vocals are probably the most inspiring element. the lyrics reminds me of an idea I had for a song myself! good to see there's already a song with the same theme.
> This is the end of everything  
> A bunch of ashes into the wind  
> I hear you talk, why don’t you sing ? It’s all over  
> I drown myself into the booze

**Scars** has a more mature form. I like that it's word-y and I feel like they could make the orchestration more focused on that, since I found it hard at some points to distinguish what he's singing. the riffs are relatively more classical, and glorious. For the same reason, the solo reminds me of Muse, which I liked very much. It leaves a few phrases for the calm outro that feel like final sighs in a 4-minute-long rant. I didn't like the final 30 seconds, I'd have enjoyed it more if it ended after the guitar solo did.

**On Our Knees** with 8 minutes is pretty long! again I like the quiet middle section, let's the song breathe, and the build-up after that also feels so great to listen to. I had to try harder than I though to connect with the text but it all seems vague to me, and at some points I feel like the phrasing and the rhythms don't quite fall in together. The soaring solo phrases blend in really well with the atmosphere.

**I Only Bet On Myself**
> I won’t wait in vain no more  
> Now I only bet on myself  
> I’d rather be alone than lonely with you
