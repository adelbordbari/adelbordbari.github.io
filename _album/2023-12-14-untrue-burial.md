## Preface  
Released in 2007, 50 minutes across 13 tracks. Suggested by a friend, but I almost regret listening to it. It wasn’t hard to get through, but also, nothing important or memorable. It’s like some guy in his 20s sat down in his bedroom and made this after a week of mouse clicks and wiggling knobs.

I want to feel good about these kinds of albums, but they still sound unstructured and lazy to me. It’s not "bad," per se, just not significant. I can pause the music, come back an hour later, continue listening, and not feel the gap. Electronic remains a non-favorite genre for now. It’s simply too lazy and improperly bundled.

## Review  
I haven’t heard a lot of electronic music, only selectively and sparsely. It starts a bit weird, but the first five minutes are enough for me to connect: the ethereal strings and drum machine patterns remind me of _Kid A_.  
**Near Dark** sounds a lot like the second track, but I like the melody better. It’s hard for me not to think of it as lazy, but let’s find out. It follows the same "form." I find the last few minutes repetitive again, with a sudden fade-out.

**Ghost Hardware** is slightly different but still similar, simpler and easier to listen to. Reminds me of _La La La La_ by _Naughty Boy_.  
**Endorphin** is odd; I can’t follow the structure. Things just happen, and a baby voice randomly comes and goes.

This is essentially elevator music at this point. I started learning to enjoy it once I stopped actively listening! The songs aren’t distinguishable, they all feel like one blob of sounds: human voice with altered pitch, drum machine, and old-timey strings.

**In McDonald’s** has a pretty good intro, more familiar to my ears.  
**Untrue**, the title track, is rather decent. It ends right when I start to feel like _"Come on, enough of this."_  
I like the ending section in **Shell of Light**.  
**Dog Shelter** is very wet, with vinyl scratches.  
The second half of **Homeless** is nice, but still nothing seriously amazing.

**Raver** is maybe my second favorite, though it feels like a loop that repeats several times. I like the sample, but what I dislike is how it cools down and makes me think it’s going to end, but then, again, it does not(?) and loops once more.
