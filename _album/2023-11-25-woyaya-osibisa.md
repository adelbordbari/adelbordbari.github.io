## Preface
It starts smoothly, moves ahead strongly, and farewells the listener with a sense of nostalgia, as if it’s saying, “We’re going to meet again.” Seven tracks, 40 minutes long. It sounds a lot like reggae, Caribbean music, and highlife.

## Review
I particularly liked Spirits Up Above, the first half of Survival, and Rabiatu—tracks 3, 4, and 6. Spirits Up Above has a bluesy guitar that feels very familiar. The sing-along part in the first half is so interesting and sounds a lot like gospel (or Ray Charles, for that matter). It starts with a familiar introduction, introduces its main interesting sound in the middle, and ends with the last two tracks as a sort of outro—more background music, like a gentle goodbye.

I like the instrumentation. It’s a blend of African instruments and mainstream Western instruments—just enough of both sides so I can tell it’s following the world while still valuing its roots. The lyrics are minimal, almost absent, but right on point.

It felt good. Nothing too deep or fancy—very authentic, memorable, and new.
